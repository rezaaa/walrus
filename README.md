## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- Telegram `API_ID`
- Telegram `API_HASH`
- Telegram bot token

---

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rezaaa/walrus.git
cd walrus
cp .env.example .env
```

## Configuration

Edit `.env` in the project root:

```env
API_ID=your_telegram_api_id
API_HASH=your_telegram_api_hash
BOT_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token
RUBIKA_SESSION=rubsession
OWNER_TELEGRAM_ID=123456789
```

Variables:

- `API_ID` - from https://my.telegram.org
- `API_HASH` - from https://my.telegram.org
- `BOT_TOKEN` - from BotFather
- `RUBIKA_SESSION` - session name or path used by `rubpy`
- `OWNER_TELEGRAM_ID` - optional; if set, only this Telegram user ID can use the bot

Runtime upload settings are stored in `queue/settings.json` after you change them from Telegram.
That lets you switch the active Rubika number/session without editing `.env` or restarting the bot.

How to get your Telegram user ID:

- forward one of your messages to [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot)
- or message [@RawDataBot](https://t.me/RawDataBot) and use the value in `from.id`

Then put that number into `.env` as `OWNER_TELEGRAM_ID`.
If you leave it unset, the bot stays open for everyone.

## Setup

Walrus uses Telegram for Rubika account setup.

After the app is running, open the Telegram bot and send:

```text
/start
```

If no saved Rubika session exists yet, the bot will guide you through setup and create the session file automatically.

Account setup and account changes work like this:

1. Send `/start` for first setup, or open `⚙️ Settings`
2. Tap `📱 Change Account` or run `/set_rubika`
3. Send the Rubika phone number
4. If Rubika asks for an account password, send it in the bot
5. Wait for the OTP prompt
6. Send the OTP code

After a successful login, the current Rubika session is replaced and reused by the worker for future uploads.

`rubpy` stores the authenticated session on disk using the configured `RUBIKA_SESSION` name. With current versions of `rubpy`, that is typically a `.rp` file such as `rubsession.rp`.

## Install on Server With Script

Install the system packages once:

```bash
apt update && apt install -y git python3 python3-venv screen
```

Clone Walrus and configure `.env`:

```bash
cd /opt
git clone https://github.com/rezaaa/walrus.git
cd /opt/walrus
cp .env.example .env
nano .env
```

Run the setup script:

```bash
bash update.sh
```

`update.sh` creates `venv/` if needed, installs dependencies, stops any old `walrus` screen session, and starts the app in a new screen session.

Verify or attach to the running app:

```bash
screen -ls
screen -r walrus
```

Then open the Telegram bot and finish Rubika setup with `/start`. Detach from screen without stopping the app with `Ctrl + A`, then `D`.

## Update

Use the same script for later updates:

```bash
cd /opt/walrus
bash update.sh
```

The script updates the code, refreshes dependencies, restarts the `screen` session, and keeps the same `.env`.

## Run Manually

If you do not want to use `screen` or `update.sh`:

```bash
cd walrus
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

This starts:

- `telegram_bot.py` - Telegram receiver and downloader
- `rubika_worker.py` - Rubika upload worker

## Bot Controls

Main menu buttons:

- `📊 Status`
- `📋 Transfers`
- `🧹 Cleanup`
- `🛑 Cancel`
- `⚙️ Settings`

Available commands:

- `/start` - open the main menu
- `/settings` - show the current Rubika session and upload destination
- `/set_rubika` - start Rubika number setup in Telegram
- `/set_rubika <phone_number>` - start Rubika number setup directly with a phone number
- `/status` - show active downloads, active upload, queue, failed count, and local storage usage
- `/transfers` - show current downloads, current upload, queued items, and retryable failed transfers
- `/cleanup` - preview removable files in `downloads/`
- `/cleanup confirm` - delete safe cleanup candidates
- `/cancel` - show clickable cancel buttons for active jobs
- `/cancel <task_id>` - cancel a specific task
- `/retry <task_id>` - requeue a failed task if its local file still exists
- `/retry_all` - requeue every retryable failed task

Transfer message buttons:

- `🛑 Cancel` on active and queued transfers
- `🔁 Retry` on failed transfers
- `🔁 Retry All Failed` in Transfers when retryable failed items exist

Successful transfers:

- the original status message is updated with the total transfer time
- the bot sends a separate completion message when the upload finishes

Direct link uploads:

- send a message containing a direct video file URL
- you can include multiple direct video URLs in one message
- when a multi-link batch finishes, the bot sends one summary with queued, failed, and cancelled counts
- supported schemes: `https://`, `http://`, and `file://`
- the link should point to the actual video file, not a webpage

## Retry Policy

Rubika uploads retry automatically on temporary errors.

- Max attempts: `5`
- Base retry delay: `3` seconds
- Backoff: `3s`, `6s`, `9s`, `12s`, `15s`

If all retries fail, the task is written to `queue/failed.jsonl` and the local downloaded file is kept for inspection or retry.

## Cancellation

You can cancel a transfer in three ways:

- tap a `🛑 Cancel` button on the transfer message
- run `/cancel` and choose a task from the buttons
- run `/cancel <task_id>`

Behavior:

- Telegram download: stops as soon as possible
- Upload queue: removed immediately
- Rubika upload: stops at the next safe checkpoint

## Storage

Runtime files:

- `downloads/` - temporary downloaded videos
- `queue/tasks.jsonl` - pending jobs
- `queue/processing.json` - the job currently being uploaded
- `queue/failed.jsonl` - failed jobs log
- `queue/cancelled/` - cancellation markers
- `queue/settings.json` - active Rubika session setting

Cleanup behavior:

- successful upload: local file is deleted
- canceled task: local file is deleted
- failed upload: local file is kept

## Troubleshooting

If the bot does not start:

- verify `.env`
- install dependencies
- confirm Telegram credentials are valid

If uploads fail:

- check the Rubika session
- review `queue/failed.jsonl`
- confirm the file still exists in `downloads/`
- check server memory and swap if the process was killed

## Inspiration

This project started after a few storage/upload experiments:

- I first tried Arvan OSS as the target, but it was too slow.
- Then I tried Google Drive, but it got filtered.
- After that, I found [caffeinexz/Tele2Rub](https://github.com/caffeinexz/Tele2Rub) and used it as the inspiration for trying Rubika instead.
- The name **Walrus** is inspired by the Black Sails series: Captain Flint's ship, Walrus.

Walrus uses a simple queue-based flow:

1. The Telegram bot receives a video in a private chat, or a direct video file URL in a text message.
2. The file is downloaded into `downloads/`.
3. A task is added to `queue/tasks.jsonl`.
4. The Rubika worker uploads the file.
5. The Telegram status message is updated during the whole transfer.
