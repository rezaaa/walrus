You are responsible for using it in a way that respects platform rules, local laws, and other people's rights.

## Inspiration

This project started after a few storage/upload experiments:

- I first tried Arvan OSS as the target, but it was too slow.
- Then I tried Google Drive, but it got filtered.
- After that, I found [caffeinexz/Tele2Rub](https://github.com/caffeinexz/Tele2Rub) and used it as the inspiration for trying Rubika instead.
- The name **Walrus** is inspired by the Black Sails series: Captain Flint's ship, Walrus.

Walrus uses a simple queue-based flow:

1. The Telegram bot receives a video in a private chat, or a direct video file URL in a text message.
2. The file is downloaded into `downloads/`.
3. A task is added to `queue/tasks.jsonl`.
4. The Rubika worker uploads the file.
5. The Telegram status message is updated during the whole transfer.

## Features

- Accepts video messages in Telegram private chat
- Accepts direct video file links such as `https://...mp4` and `file:///...mp4`
- Accepts multiple direct video file links in one message and queues each one
- Sends a final summary message after a multi-link batch finishes intake
- Keeps a local upload queue to avoid overlapping jobs
- Shows live download and upload progress
- Supports upload retries for temporary Rubika errors
- Supports canceling active or queued transfers
- Supports retrying failed transfers when the downloaded file still exists
- Provides quick action buttons for status, transfers, cleanup, cancel, and retry
- Sends a completion notification when a transfer finishes successfully
- Shows total elapsed transfer time on successful uploads
- Lets you switch the active Rubika number/session from Telegram
- Uploads videos with their original filename

## Bot Controls

Main menu buttons:

- `📊 Status`
- `📋 Transfers`
- `🧹 Cleanup`
- `🛑 Cancel`
- `⚙️ Settings`

Available commands:

- `/start` - open the main menu
- `/settings` - show the current Rubika session and upload destination
- `/set_rubika` - start Rubika number setup in Telegram
- `/set_rubika <phone_number>` - start Rubika number setup directly with a phone number
- `/status` - show active downloads, active upload, queue, failed count, and local storage usage
- `/transfers` - show current downloads, current upload, queued items, and retryable failed transfers
- `/cleanup` - preview removable files in `downloads/`
- `/cleanup confirm` - delete safe cleanup candidates
- `/cancel` - show clickable cancel buttons for active jobs
- `/cancel <task_id>` - cancel a specific task
- `/retry <task_id>` - requeue a failed task if its local file still exists
- `/retry_all` - requeue every retryable failed task

Transfer message buttons:

- `🛑 Cancel` on active and queued transfers
- `🔁 Retry` on failed transfers
- `🔁 Retry All Failed` in Transfers when retryable failed items exist

Successful transfers:

- the original status message is updated with the total transfer time
- the bot sends a separate completion message when the upload finishes

Direct link uploads:

- send a message containing a direct video file URL
- you can include multiple direct video URLs in one message
- when a multi-link batch finishes, the bot sends one summary with queued, failed, and cancelled counts
- supported schemes: `https://`, `http://`, and `file://`
- the link should point to the actual video file, not a webpage

## Retry Policy

Rubika uploads retry automatically on temporary errors.

- Max attempts: `5`
- Base retry delay: `3` seconds
- Backoff: `3s`, `6s`, `9s`, `12s`, `15s`

If all retries fail, the task is written to `queue/failed.jsonl` and the local downloaded file is kept for inspection or retry.

## Cancellation

You can cancel a transfer in three ways:

- tap a `🛑 Cancel` button on the transfer message
- run `/cancel` and choose a task from the buttons
- run `/cancel <task_id>`

Behavior:

- Telegram download: stops as soon as possible
- Upload queue: removed immediately
- Rubika upload: stops at the next safe checkpoint

## Storage

Runtime files:

- `downloads/` - temporary downloaded videos
- `queue/tasks.jsonl` - pending jobs
- `queue/processing.json` - the job currently being uploaded
- `queue/failed.jsonl` - failed jobs log
- `queue/cancelled/` - cancellation markers
- `queue/settings.json` - active Rubika session setting

Cleanup behavior:

- successful upload: local file is deleted
- canceled task: local file is deleted
- failed upload: local file is kept

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- Telegram `API_ID`
- Telegram `API_HASH`
- Telegram bot token
- Valid Rubika session support through `rubpy`

---

## 🛠 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rezaaa/walrus.git
cd walrus
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

Create `.env` in the project root:

```env
API_ID=your_telegram_api_id
API_HASH=your_telegram_api_hash
BOT_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token
RUBIKA_SESSION=rubsession
OWNER_TELEGRAM_ID=123456789
```

Variables:

- `API_ID` - from https://my.telegram.org
- `API_HASH` - from https://my.telegram.org
- `BOT_TOKEN` - from BotFather
- `RUBIKA_SESSION` - session name or path used by `rubpy`
- `OWNER_TELEGRAM_ID` - optional; if set, only this Telegram user ID can use the bot

Runtime upload settings are stored in `queue/settings.json` after you change them from Telegram.
That lets you switch the active Rubika number/session without editing `.env` or restarting the bot.

How to get your Telegram user ID:

- forward one of your messages to [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot)
- or message [@RawDataBot](https://t.me/RawDataBot) and use the value in `from.id`

Then put that number into `.env` as `OWNER_TELEGRAM_ID`.
If you leave it unset, the bot stays open for everyone.

## Rubika Login Flow

Walrus supports two Rubika login flows:

1. First run bootstrap:
   If no saved Rubika session exists yet, the worker may ask in the terminal for the phone number and OTP code.
2. Account changes later:
   After the app is already running, you can switch the Rubika account from Telegram.

Telegram-based account setup works like this:

1. Open `⚙️ Settings`
2. Tap `📱 Change Account` or run `/set_rubika`
3. Send the Rubika phone number
4. Wait for the OTP prompt
5. Send the OTP code

After a successful login, the current Rubika session is replaced and reused by the worker for future uploads.

`rubpy` stores the authenticated session on disk using the configured `RUBIKA_SESSION` name. With current versions of `rubpy`, that is typically a `.rp` file such as `rubsession.rp`.

## First Run

If the configured Rubika session does not exist yet, the first worker run may ask for:

1. Your phone number
2. The OTP code sent by Rubika

After that, the saved session is reused unless you later replace it from Telegram.

## Run

Start both processes with:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

This starts:

- `telegram_bot.py` - Telegram receiver and downloader
- `rubika_worker.py` - Rubika upload worker

## Run with Screen

```bash
screen -S walrus
cd /opt/walrus
source venv/bin/activate
python main.py
```

Detach without stopping the app:

```text
Ctrl + A, then D
```

Useful commands:

- `screen -ls`
- `screen -r walrus` - attach to the running session
- `screen -S walrus -X quit`

If multiple old sessions exist:

```bash
for s in $(screen -ls | awk '/walrus/ {print $1}'); do
  screen -S "$s" -X quit
done
```

## Update on Server

Typical restart flow:

```bash
cd /opt/walrus
git pull origin main
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

for s in $(screen -ls | awk '/walrus/ {print $1}'); do
  screen -S "$s" -X quit
done

screen -dmS walrus bash -lc 'cd /opt/walrus && source venv/bin/activate && python main.py'
```

Then verify:

```bash
screen -ls
```

Optional update script:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

APP_DIR="${APP_DIR:-/opt/walrus}"
BRANCH="${BRANCH:-main}"
SCREEN_NAME="${SCREEN_NAME:-walrus}"
PYTHON_BIN="${PYTHON_BIN:-python3}"
VENV_PYTHON="$APP_DIR/venv/bin/python"

echo "==> Updating code"
cd "$APP_DIR"
git pull --ff-only origin "$BRANCH"

if [ ! -x "$VENV_PYTHON" ]; then
  echo "==> Creating virtualenv"
  "$PYTHON_BIN" -m venv "$APP_DIR/venv" || {
    echo "Could not create venv. On Ubuntu, install it with: apt update && apt install -y python3-venv"
    exit 1
  }
fi

echo "==> Installing dependencies"
"$VENV_PYTHON" -m pip install -r requirements.txt

if ! command -v screen >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  echo "screen is not installed. Install it with: apt update && apt install -y screen"
  exit 1
fi

echo "==> Stopping old screen sessions"
while read -r session; do
  [ -n "$session" ] || continue
  screen -S "$session" -X quit || true
done < <(screen -ls | awk -v name="$SCREEN_NAME" '$0 ~ name {print $1}' || true)

echo "==> Starting app in screen"
screen -dmS "$SCREEN_NAME" bash -lc "cd '$APP_DIR' && exec '$VENV_PYTHON' main.py"

echo "==> Done"
echo "Check sessions with: screen -ls"
echo "Attach with: screen -r $SCREEN_NAME"
```

The same script is included as `update.sh` in the repo. On a fresh server:

```bash
cd /opt/walrus
bash update.sh
```

## Troubleshooting

If the bot does not start:

- verify `.env`
- install dependencies
- confirm Telegram credentials are valid

If uploads fail:

- check the Rubika session
- review `queue/failed.jsonl`
- confirm the file still exists in `downloads/`
- check server memory and swap if the process was killed
